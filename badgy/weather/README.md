This code originated life as an example weather station application in the badgey project but has morphed into something quite a bit more complete.  

* Displays a temperature range for the current day.
* The forecast data is resilient to decreasing data points.
* Sunrise and sunset are displayed.
* Usage of RTC space to save necessary state across deep sleeps.
