# Badgy

The 'Badgy' is a great little board that combines the ESP8266 and an eInk display.  They can be purchased from here:
https://www.tindie.com/products/squarofumi/badgy-iot-badge/.

This directory is the root of all of my projects that run on this platform.

Setup information can be found in the README.md file for https://github.com/mchughj/badgy.  Note that this (as of 6/20/2019) contains commits not yet folded into the main Badgy github.
